# What does pygame do?

Pygame helps you draw images, drawing anything on the screen can be hard. Pygame helps us create a window and display images. Also to play sounds.

Pygame also can help in checking for player input without using input(). This function would normally pause code execution

+ Other dev tools

Pygame is useful for prototyping games, it is very rarely used to make commercial games.

It is also good as a learning tool to train yourself with how to build systems with good practices and overall become a better programmer.

# 

In a game, the framerate can fluctuate. This may affect the game's experience and thus we need to control how fast we want to update the game.

#

Any kind of image has a surface. The display is a surface. Other objects that are drawn on this surface we need a (regular) surface.

Whenever we draw surfaces and specify drawing positions, units are in pixels

#

Rectangles allows us to have control over which 'point' and 'side' we'll be using to place surfaces on our screen surface. Surfaces can be "blitted" onto a position in the screen by using for reference its topleft vertix, by using rectangles we get access to topleft, midtop, topright and so on... to use as references to place surfaces. This gives us more flexibility when placing surfaces onto the screen
