# What does pygame do?

Pygame helps you draw images, drawing anything on the screen can be hard. Pygame helps us create a window and display images. Also to play sounds.

Pygame also can help in checking for player input without using input(). This function would normally pause code execution

+ Other dev tools

Pygame is useful for prototyping games, it is very rarely used to make commercial games.

It is also good as a learning tool to train yourself with how to build systems with good practices and overall become a better programmer.

In a game, the framerate can fluctuate. This may affect the game's experience and thus we need to control how fast we want to update the game.

#

Any kind of image has a surface. The display is a surface. Other objects that are drawn on this surface we need a (regular) surface.

Whenever we draw surfaces and specify drawing positions, units are in pixels
